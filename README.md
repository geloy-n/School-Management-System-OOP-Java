# ðŸ“š School Management System (Java OOP Practice)

A simple Java console-based application designed to practice and demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including **Inheritance**, **Interfaces**, **Polymorphism**, **Aggregation**, and more.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ… Manage Students, Teachers, Admin staff, and Courses  
âœ… Compute salaries dynamically for Teachers (based on handled courses) and Admins (with fixed allowances)  
âœ… Aggregate shared Course objects between Students and Teachers  
âœ… Demonstrates runtime polymorphism via a `Payable` interface  
âœ… Clean, organized OOP structure and class relationships  

---

## ðŸ“– Concepts Practiced

- âœ… Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- âœ… Constructors
- âœ… Overloaded Constructors (optionally extendable)
- âœ… Array of Objects (`ArrayList`)
- âœ… Static variables and methods
- âœ… Inheritance
- âœ… `super` keyword for constructor chaining
- âœ… Method Overriding
- âœ… Abstraction via interfaces
- âœ… Interfaces (`Payable`)
- âœ… Polymorphism (including **runtime polymorphism**)
- âœ… Getters and Setters
- âœ… Aggregation (shared Course objects)
- âœ… Wrapper classes (implicitly via `ArrayList`)
- âœ… Clean sequencing of object state setup and method calls
